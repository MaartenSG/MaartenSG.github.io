Hi, I am Maarten Sollewijn Gelpke. I am a bioinformatics scientist with a PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. My career path has flowed via postdoc positions at UC Berkeley and JGI, research scientist in pharma and freelance consulting. Main focus at all stations has been the analysis of large amounts of genome sequencing, transcriptomics and proteomics data. Early days data processing, analysis and visualisation was based on a mix of commercial tools and Perl and SQL. Later bionformatics tools shifted towards R with initial data processing from the unix command line. Exciting developments see the need for data scientists for large scale data driven projects in multiple industries.
